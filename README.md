# My Personal Website

Not too sure what to write in here. But this is my first attempt 
to create my own website from scratch. So far it proving difficult as its hard to remember everything that learnt so far, but definitely loving the challenge.
I've downloaded a font from Google (Poppins Font) and added it to the Family-Font Section.  

# Hero Section
so I've named the Intro part from My Personal Website to the CV and Contact button id=Hero. I've created a dummy PDF for the CV and will direct the Contact Info, when clicked on, to the bottom of the page which will lead to the Fb, Insta etc. Icons. Also just learnt about the :hover att.
The Nav bar at the top I had to youtube just to help with the spacing. But each of those will lead to a different part of the page.
I've also added an image which would usually disguise as my personal profile picture but... I dont want to display my mug right now.

# Uniform Section

In this section I added the list element with links attached to it which would usually lead to my projects relating to those listed but... they're blank.

# Boot Section

This is pretty much the last section of the webpage. I added social media buttons, adding a hover animation to it. I jumped on youtube to see how I could do this. 
I ran the code through the validation check-up, there was a few errors popping up which some were rectified and some were just plain confusing, but this being the first time ever writing code from scratch to create my first webpage. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. Plenty of room for improvement.
