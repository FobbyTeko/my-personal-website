# My Personal Website

Not too sure what to write in here. But this is my first attempt 
to create my own website from scratch. So far it proving difficult as its hard to remember everything that learnt so far, but definitely loving the challenge.

# Hero Section
so I've named the Intro part from My Personal Website to the CV and Contact button id=Hero. I've created a dummy PDF for the CV and will direct the Contact Info, when clicked on, to the bottom of the page which will lead to the Fb, Insta etc. Icons. Also just learnt about the :hover att.
The Nav bar at the top I had to youtube just to help with the spacing. But each of those will lead to a different part of the page.
